# Changelog

## v0.4.51

**New Features**:

- Sinks - **Breaking Changes**: From now on, no need to explicitly publish playbook results to a specific target.

  Within the playbook's code we only need to create a `Finding` object. It will be published to the configured `sinks`

  For example:
  instead of writing:

  `send_to_slack(...)`

  write:

  `event.finding = Finding(title="...")`

- Slack api key: Slack api key was moved from the `runner` deployment file, into the slack sink configuration in the `active_playbooks.yaml` configuration file.

## v0.4.50

**New Features**:

- New enrichers: NodeBashEnricher, CPUThrottlingAnalysis, and DeploymentStatusEnricher
- Add a log line when an alert is silenced. The format is `Silencing alert {alert_name} due to silencer {silencer_name}`

**Bug Fixes**:

- Fix handling of Slack messages with very long titles or contents. This bug caused certain alerts to be dropped and not forwarded to Slack.

**Other Changes**:

- Minor formatting and styling changes to Slack messages
- Documentation improvements

## v0.4.46

**Breaking Changes:**

- The json format for deployment_babysitter events sent to Kafka was updated.

**New Features**:

- New `pod_babysitter` which is similar to the `deployment_babysitter` but tracks pods.

## v0.4.45

**Upgrade Steps:**

- If you use the `alerts_integration` playbook and set an override for the default_enricher:
  - Update the `default_enricher` field from `default_enricher: your_enricher` to:

```yaml
default_enrichers:
  - name: "your_enricher"`
```

**Breaking Changes:**

- The `default_enricher` field for the `alerts_integration` playbook was changed from a string to an array.
