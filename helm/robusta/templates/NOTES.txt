Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name | title }} {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}

As an open source project, we collect general usage statistics.
This data is extremely limited and contains only general metadata to help us understand usage patterns.
If you are willing to share additional data, please do so! It really help us improve Robusta.

You can set sendAdditionalTelemetry: true as a Helm value to send exception reports and additional data.
This is disabled by default. 

To opt-out of telemetry entirely, set a ENABLE_TELEMETRY=false environment variable on the robusta-runner deployment.
