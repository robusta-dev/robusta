# About Robusta
Robusta is an open source platform for automated troubleshooting and maintenance. We turn Kubernetes expertise into re-usable code.

Robusta automates everything that happens after you deploy your application.

You can use any of our builtin actions, or easily add your own.

## Examples
You can monitor crashing pods and send their logs to Slack:

```yaml
triggers:
  - on_prometheus_alert:
      alert_name: KubePodCrashLooping
actions:
  - logs_enricher: {}
sinks:
  - slack
```

There are also builtin automations to analyze common alerts.

You can also trigger automations manually. For example, [attach a debugger to a python pod](https://docs.robusta.dev/master/catalog/actions/python-troubleshooting.html#python-debugger):
```commandline
robusta playbooks trigger python_debugger name=mypod namespace=default
```

[There are over 50 builtin automations.](https://docs.robusta.dev/master/catalog/actions/index.html)
