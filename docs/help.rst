Common Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This list contains some common errors we have encountered over time. If you can't find your answer here,
contact support@robusta.dev or go to `our slack channel <https://bit.ly/robusta-slack>`_.


.. details:: command not found: robusta (CLI not in path)

    1. Determine where the Robusta-cli binary file is located

    .. code-block:: bash
        :name: cb-find-python-cli-loc

        find / -regex '.*/bin/robusta' 2>/dev/null

    2. Add the path you found (e.g ``/opt/homebrew/bin/``) to your PATH. To do so, find your shell config file ( ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc etc...) and append the following:

    .. code-block:: bash
        :name: add-path-var

        export PATH="$PATH:<new-path>"

    3. Reopen the terminal or run:

    .. code-block:: bash
        :name: cb-refresh-terminal

        source <your-shell-config-file>

    .. admonition:: Alternative Solution

      Instead of modifying PATH, run Robusta commands via the python3 binary: ``python3 -m robusta.cli.main gen-config``

.. details:: SSL certificate errors on Mac OS

    This implies a python package with certificates is missing on your system.

    To fix it, run ``/Applications/Python 3.9/Install Certificates.command``

    For more info see:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52805115/certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate

.. details:: robusta-runner isn't working or has exceptions

    Check the pod's memory consumption. If necessary, increase the memory request in the Helm values:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        runner:
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: 2048Mi
            limits:
              memory: 2048Mi

    Here's a representative error caused by too little memory:

    .. details:: Discovery Error

        .. code-block::
