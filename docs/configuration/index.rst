Integrations Overview
==========================


Robusta can gather data from multiple sources, enrich them and send actionable alerts to many sinks (destinations). These integrations with external tools are done using Robusta's Helm values.

We highly recommend configuring at least one metrics source, such as Prometheus, one alert system (recommended: AlertManager), and one sink like Slack.

Follow these guides after :ref:`installing Robusta <install>`.
