Exporting Alert History
==========================

Robusta allows you to export alert history data using a simple API call. This feature helps in fetching historical alert details based on specific criteria such as ``alert_name``, ``account_id``, and time range.

Example Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following ``curl`` command demonstrates how to export alert history data for the ``CrashLoopBackoff`` alert:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl --location 'https://api.robusta.dev/api/alerts?alert_name=CrashLoopBackoff&account_id=ACCOUNT_ID&start_ts=2024-09-02T04%3A02%3A05.032Z&end_ts=2024-09-17T05%3A02%3A05.032Z' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_HERE'

In the command, make sure to replace the following placeholders:

- ``ACCOUNT_ID``: Your account ID, which can be found in your ``generated_values.yaml`` file.
- ``TOKEN_HERE``: Your API token for authentication. You can generate this token in the platform by navigating to **Settings** -> **API Keys** -> **New API Key**, and creating a key with the "Read Alerts" permission.

Response Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The response will contain an array of alert objects with detailed information, as shown in the example below:
