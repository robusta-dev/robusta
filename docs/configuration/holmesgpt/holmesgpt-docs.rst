Configuring HolmesGPT with Robusta
-----------------------------------

When configuring HolmesGPT with Robusta, follow the **Robusta Helm Chart configuration method** described in the HolmesGPT documentation rather than standalone CLI installation.

Key points:

* Use the ``enableHolmesGPT: true`` setting in your Robusta Helm values
* Configure data sources and advanced settings using the Helm chart configuration examples provided in the HolmesGPT docs
* Refer to the `Helm Configuration Reference <https://holmesgpt.dev/reference/helm-configuration/>`_ for advanced HolmesGPT settings specific to Robusta deployments
