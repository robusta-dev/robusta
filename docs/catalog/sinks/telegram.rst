Robusta can send playbook results to Telegram conversations.

.. note::

    Tables are sent as file attachments to Telegram sinks because it's too big for most Telegram chat clients.

    In addition, 2-way interactivity (``CallbackBlock``) isn't implemented yet.

Get your Bot token
------------------------------------------------
Follow the instructions `here <https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather>`_ to create a new Bot, and get your Bot token.

Chat id
------------------------------------------------
Before using the sink, you must first start the conversation with your Bot. (Locate your Bot in your Telegram app, and start the conversation)

If you want to send messages to a group, add the created Bot to your group (new or existing) and give the Bot the following group permissions: ``Send Messages``, ``Send Media``, ``Send Stickers and GIFs``

Next, we will need to obtain the ``chat id``. Checkout this `post <https://dev.to/rizkyrajitha/get-notifications-with-telegram-bot-537l#:~:text=keep%20the%20access%20token%20securely.%20Anyone%20with%20access%20token%20can%20manipulate%20your%20bot>`_ to find out how.

Thread id
------------------------------------------------
You can configure Robusta to send alerts to a specific message thread (topic) if your group chat has them enabled.
To do this you need to:
1. Obtain the thread id by copying a link to the topic (``Topic Info - Copy Topic Link`` in the desktop client). The number after the last forward slash is the thread id.
2. Pass the thread id to the Telegram sink via the ``thread_id`` parameter in the sink configuration.

Configuring the Telegram sink
------------------------------------------------
Now we're ready to configure the Telegram sink.

.. admonition:: Add this to your generated_values.yaml

    .. code-block:: yaml

        sinksConfig:
        - telegram_sink:
            name: personal_telegram sink
            bot_token: <YOUR BOT TOKEN>
            chat_id: <CHAT ID>
            thread_id: <THREAD ID> # Optional thread (topic) ID
.. note::

    If you don't want Robusta to send file attachments, set ``send_files`` to ``False`` under your Telegram sink. (True by default)

Save the file and run

.. code-block:: bash
   :name: cb-add-telegram-sink

    helm upgrade robusta robusta/robusta --values=generated_values.yaml
    
You should now get playbooks results in Telegram!
