Open Source vs SaaS
################################

Robusta has three deployment options:

- **Open Source**: MIT-licensed engine that sends alerts to Slack, Teams, etc. No web UI.
- **SaaS**: Open source engine + hosted web UI with additional features.
- **Self-hosted**: Open source engine + on-premise web UI (enterprise plans).

**Which should I choose?**

Most teams use the SaaS option for the complete feature set without infrastructure overhead. The open source version works well if you only need basic alert routing to external systems.

Pricing
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Robusta OSS is and always will be free. It is MIT licensed.

The Robusta UI is `free to get started <https://home.robusta.dev/pricing>`_ on our SaaS platform. If you want to self-host the UI, you'll need an enterprise plan.
