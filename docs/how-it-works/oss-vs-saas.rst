Open Source vs SaaS
################################

Robusta has three deployment options:

- **Open Source**: MIT-licensed engine that sends alerts to Slack, Teams, etc. No web UI.
- **SaaS**: Open source engine + hosted web UI with :doc:`additional features <../configuration/exporting/robusta-pro-features>`.
- **Self-hosted**: Open source engine + on-premise web UI (enterprise plans).

**Which should I choose?**

Most teams use the SaaS option for the :doc:`complete feature set <../configuration/exporting/robusta-pro-features>` without infrastructure overhead. The open source version works well if you only need basic alert routing to external systems.

Pricing
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Robusta OSS is and always will be free. It is MIT licensed.

The Robusta UI is `free to get started <https://home.robusta.dev/pricing>`_ on our SaaS platform. If you want to self-host the UI, you'll need an enterprise plan.
