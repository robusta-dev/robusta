Does Robusta have Builtin Alerts?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, you can install all-in-one bundle to install Robusta along with well-tested enriched alerts.

If you already have alerts, you can skip the bundle and send your existing alerts to Robusta instead. They'll be enriched with extra context.

Can Robusta monitor alerts from outside Kubernetes?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Robusta OSS is designed for Kubernetes environments and requires both Kubernetes and Prometheus to provide the most value.

Robusta Pro extends beyond Kubernetes and can ingest alerts from any monitoring system via webhook, including Nagios, SolarWinds, and custom sources. These alerts get the same AI analysis and correlation features.
