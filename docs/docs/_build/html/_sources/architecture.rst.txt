Standard Architecture
-------------------------

Robusta is installed and managed with Helm.

Automations engine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The main component of Robusta is the automation engine, which runs in-cluster as two Kubernetes deployments

robusta-forwarder
    Connects to the APIServer and monitors Kubernetes changes. Forwards them to robusta-runner.

robusta-runner
    Executes playbooks

Bundled Prometheus stack (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Robusta includes an optional :ref:`embedded Prometheus stack`, preconfigured with alerts for Kubernetes according to best practices.

If you already use Prometheus, you can :ref:`point it at Robusta<Sending Alerts to Robusta>` instead.

Web UI (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is a `web UI <http://home.robusta.dev/ui?from=docs>`_ [#f1]_ which provides a single pane of glass to monitor
all your alerts and pods across multiple clusters.

CLI (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :ref:`robusta cli <CLI Commands>` has two main uses:

1. Making it easier to install Robusta by autogenerating Helm values
2. Manually triggering Robusta troubleshooting workflows (e.g. to grab a heap dump from any Java pod)

It also has features useful for developing Robusta itself.
