Welcome to Robusta!
=====================
Robusta is the best way to stay on top of Kubernetes alerts. It monitors incoming alerts and triggers automated
responses.

Features:

* Add missing context to Prometheus alerts and filter out false alarms
* Reduce the volume of flooded alert channels with prebuilt fixes
* Monitor changes to Kubernetes resources
* Benefit from open source playbooks written by other companies

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You configure triggers and actions in YAML:

.. admonition:: Example Configuration

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - triggers:
          - on_prometheus_alert:
              alert_name: HostOutOfDiskSpace
          actions:
          - node_bash_enricher:
              bash_command: "df -h"


Results are sent to Slack, MSTeams, or other destinations:

.. admonition:: Example Slack Message

    .. image:: /images/crash-report.png

You can write your own playbook actions in Python:

.. admonition:: Example Action

    .. code-block:: python

        @action
        def my_action(alert: PrometheusKubernetesAlert):
            print(f"The alert {alert.alert_name} fired on pod {alert.pod.metadata.name}")
            print(f"The pod has these processes:", alert.pod.exec("ps aux"))
            print(f"The pod has {len(alert.pod.spec.containers)} containers")



Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Robusta was inspired by three good ideas from other domains:

1. Automated tests make finding bugs a continuous and unavoidable process
2. Infrastructure as code makes complicated workflows reproducible
3. Package managers like Helm share operational knowledge via open source

**Robusta makes troubleshooting automated, reproducible, and open source**.

More examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some common things people automate with Robusta:

* Send logs of crashing pods to Slack/MSTeams
* Enrich ``HostOutOfDiskSpace`` alerts with details about large files
* Enrich all alerts with diffs of recently changed deployments
* Attach a CPU profiler for 2 seconds on ``HighCPU`` without restarting your application
* Track and audit every change in a Kubernetes cluster
* Increase max replicas from Slack during an incident

See the :ref:`builtin playbooks <List of built-in playbooks>` or write your own.
