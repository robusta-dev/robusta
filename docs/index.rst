Welcome to the Robusta Docs
=============================

Robusta is an observability and monitoring platform built for Kubernetes. It is commonly used as an extension to Prometheus, or standalone.

        **Reasons to use Robusta:**

        * Get better alerts - with automatic insights
        * Spend less time defining alerts - with opinionated defaults
        * Remove blind-spots - with direct APIServer monitoring
        * Reduce alert fatigue - with smart silencing and routing

        **Things you can do with Robusta:**

        * Correlate Prometheus alerts with pod logs, Kubernetes events, and more
        * Notify on Kubernetes-native errors without PromQL
        * Analyze alerts with `ChatGPT <https://github.com/robusta-dev/kubernetes-chatgpt-bot/>`_ or expert runbooks
        * Remediate alerts with automatic commands
