=============================

Robusta is an observability and monitoring platform built for Kubernetes. It is commonly used as an extension to Prometheus, or standalone.

        **Why Use Robusta?**

        * Get better alerts - with automatic insights
        * Spend less time defining alerts - with opinionated defaults
        * Remove blind-spots - with direct APIServer monitoring
        * Reduce alert fatigue - with smart silencing and alert routing

        **Key Capabilities**

        * Correlate Prometheus alerts with pod logs, k8s events, and more
        * Notify on Kubernetes-native errors without PromQL
        * Alert analysis powered by `ChatGPT <https://github.com/robusta-dev/kubernetes-chatgpt-bot/>`_ and expert runbooks
        * Remediate alerts with automatic commands
