Welcome to Robusta!
=====================
Robusta is the best way to respond to alerts in Kubernetes clusters. It automates the process of tracking,
investigating, and fixing production issues. To get started, just install Robusta and enable builtin
troubleshooting playbooks for common problems.

Common Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using Robusta you can automatically:

* See the largest files on a node when a ``HostOutOfDiskSpace`` Prometheus alert fires
* See which Kubernetes resources were updated prior to an alert firing
* Safely run a CPU profiler for 2 seconds in production on ``HighCPU`` alerts
* Track and audit every change in a Kubernetes cluster
* Enrich Prometheus alerts with pod logs and forward them to Slack/MSTeams
* Apply temporary workarounds to your cluster during an incident like increasing HPA max replicas
* Share troubleshooting workflows with colleagues as code and not outdated wiki pages

Robusta turns all the above maintenance operations into re-usable playbooks. See the :ref:`list of builtin playbooks <List of built-in playbooks>` or write your own.

Core Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Robusta is based on three principles:

1. **Automation improves software quality while saving time.** This is the reason automated testing exists.
Without automation you wouldn't test as frequently or as thoroughly, letting bugs creep through the cracks.
Robusta lets you handle alerts the same way you test software: via easy automation that you configure once and
run frequently.

2. **Automation makes complicated workflows reproducible by everyone.** This is the key principle of
infrastructure-as-code. Setting up servers manually leads to inconsistent results that are
hard to reproduce. It also creates knowledge silos where only certain individuals can setup new servers.
Responding to alerts manually in production is the same. We built Robusta to apply the principles of
infrastructure-as-code to alert handling.

3. **Your environment is not unique**. This is the reason why companies in different industries can
use the same Helm charts, install the same software, and have the same alerts in production. Robusta provides
out of the box playbooks for responding to those common issues with well-known best practices.


How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robusta installs two lightweight deployments in your Kubernetes cluster. The `forwarder` monitors
the cluster for changes and the `runner` uses your Robusta configuration file to decide when to run
playbooks.

Playbooks can be sourced from the Robusta open source community or written by you in Python.
Configuring playbooks looks like this:


.. admonition:: Example Configuration

    .. code-block:: yaml

        - triggers:
          - on_prometheus_alert:
              alert_name: HostHighCpuLoad
          actions:
          - node_bash_enricher:
              bash_command: "df -h"

``on_prometheus_alert`` is a builtin *trigger* and ``node_bash_enricher`` is a builtin *action*.
Writing your own action in Python is as simple as this:

.. admonition:: Example Action

    .. code-block:: python

        @action
        def my_action(alert: PrometheusKubernetesAlert):
            print(f"The alert {alert.alert_name} fired on pod {alert.pod.metadata.name}")
            print(f"The pod has these processes:", alert.pod.exec("ps aux"))
            print(f"The pod has {len(alert.pod.spec.containers)} containers")

You can access and update in Python any Kubernetes field for Pods, Deployments, and other resources.

A playbook's result is automatically sent to Slack, MSTeams, or other destinations you configure.
