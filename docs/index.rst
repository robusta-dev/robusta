Welcome to the Robusta Docs
=============================

Robusta is a Kubernetes-native observability platform. It is commonly used as an extension to Prometheus, or a standalone monitoring solution.

Robusta gathers Kubernetes-specific data when alerts fire, as well as tracking CrashLoopBackOffs, Job failures, and other native Kubernetes events.

Finally, it routes notifications to Slack, MSTeams, PagerDuty (and more) via a unified event bus. In short, better notifications, unified routing.

        * Correlate Prometheus alerts with pod logs
        * Attach missing information to your alerts (e.g. ``kubectl get events``)
        * Notify on Kubernetes-native errors, like Job failure
        * Understand *why* alerts fired, with automated community runbooks
        * Remediate alerts by automatically running commands

        ...and more!
