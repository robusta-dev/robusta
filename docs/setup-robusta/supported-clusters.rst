Supported Clusters
################################

We support all Kubernetes distributions, with the following caveats:

* OpenShift is supported but requires :ref:`one extra step when installing <Installing on OpenShift>`.
* Minikube is not supported. We recommend using KIND for test clusters.

Companies are known to be using Robusta on: EKS, GKE, AKS, OpenShift, RKE, Civo, Digital Ocean, and KIND.

Using Robusta on a cloud not listed above? `Tell us <https://github.com/robusta-dev/robusta/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=other.md&title=>`_ and we'll update the list.
