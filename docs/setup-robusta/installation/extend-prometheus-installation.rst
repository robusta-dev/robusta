Integrate with Existing Prometheus
####################################

In this five minute tutorial, we integrate Robusta with an existing Prometheus install. By the end of the tutorial,
you will see your Prometheus alerts in Robusta and have improved alert notifications.

Prerequisites
---------------------

* A :ref:`supported Kubernetes cluster <Supported Kubernetes Clusters>`
* A Prometheus installation
* Helm, installed on a machine with access to the cluster

.. include:: ../_questions.rst

.. jinja:: install_integrate_prometheus
   :header_update_levels:
   :file: setup-robusta/installation/_generate_config.jinja

.. include:: ./_helm_install.rst

See Robusta in action
------------------------------

Robusta has two primary sources of alerts:

* Prometheus alerts, forwarded by AlertManager to Robusta
* APIServer Alerts, generated by Robusta itself (e.g. for OOMKilled pods)

Out of the box, both sources are enabled. Robusta uses Prometheus as the primary source of alerts, while adding on
complimentary alerts directly from the APIServer.

You can disable either source later, but for now let's demonstrate what Robusta can do with each one.

Testing out Prometheus alerts
*******************************
TODO: first demonstrate with simulated alert, then show you how to configure.

Testing out APIServer alerts
****************************

Let's deploy a crashing pod. Robusta will identify the problem and notify us:

.. code-block:: bash
   :name: cb-apply-crashpod

   kubectl apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/robusta-lab/283609047306dc1f05cf59806ade30b6/raw

Verify that the pod is actually crashing:

.. code-block:: console
   :name: cb-verify-crash-pod-crashing

   $ kubectl get pods -A | grep crashpod
   NAME                            READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
   crashpod-64d8fbfd-s2dvn         0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   1          7s

Once the pod has reached two restarts, you'll get notified in Slack (or whatever alternative integration you configured):

.. admonition:: Example Slack Message

    .. image:: /images/crash-report.png


Now open the `Robusta UI <https://platform.robusta.dev/>`_ and look for the same message there.
If you didn't enable the UI during installation, don't worry. You can enable it at any time by running ``robusta integrations ui``.

# TODO: will enabling it this way mess up the accountID?

Finally, clean up the crashing pod:

.. code-block:: bash
   :name: cb-delete-crashpod

   kubectl delete deployment crashpod
