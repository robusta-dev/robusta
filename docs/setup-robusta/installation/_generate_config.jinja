Generate a Config
-----------------------------------

Robusta needs settings to work. For example, if you use Slack then Robusta needs a Slack API key. These settings are configured as Helm values.

Choose a configuration method below:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Web Installation (recommended)
        :name: web-installation-tab

        Create the configuration by signing up `for a free Robusta UI account ↗ <https://platform.robusta.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_content=install-page>`_

        .. details:: Why configure an Open Source project from a SaaS platform?

            You can use Robusta OSS without any SaaS components, however you'll need integrations like Slack or MS Teams if you want to see Robusta doing anything.

            The configuration for Slack can be difficult to generate on your own, so we provide a free UI to assist.
            
            You can use the UI to generate Helm values and then disable the UI, or you can use the free tier forever! We also have a paid tier with our most powerful AI agent included.

    .. tab-item:: pipx
        :name: pip-cli-tab

        First install `pipx <https://github.com/pypa/pipx>`_.

        Then use pipx to install and run the robusta cli: 

        .. code-block:: bash
            :name: cb-pip-install

            pipx run robusta-cli gen-config {{ gen_config_flags }}

        .. details:: pipx vs pip

            The ``robusta`` cli can also be installed with pip, but due to Python limitations, this can lead to dependency issues, as pip doesn't install packages in isolated environments.

            But if you prefer pip instead of pipx - install with ``pip install -U robusta-cli --no-cache`` and run with ``robusta gen-config {{ gen_config_flags }}``
            
            * Python 3.7 or higher is required.
            * Use ``pip3`` on systems with both Python 2 and Python 3.
            * A ``command not found: robusta`` error means :ref:`Python's script directory is not in your PATH <Getting Support>`.

    .. tab-item:: docker
        :name: docker-cli-tab

        Use the ``robusta`` cli tool to generate the Helm values. Run it via the pre-built docker container.

        .. details:: Requirements and Troubleshooting

            A Docker daemon and bash are required.

            On Windows, use bash inside `WSL <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_.

        .. code-block:: bash
            :name: cb-docker-cli-download

            curl -fsSL -o robusta https://docs.robusta.dev/master/_static/robusta
            chmod +x robusta
            ./robusta gen-config {{ gen_config_flags }}

You should now have a ``generated_values.yaml`` file with a Robusta config. **Save this file!**
You'll need it to install Robusta on new clusters.
