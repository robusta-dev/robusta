Managed Prometheus Alerts
##########################

You can manage your Prometheus alerts with the Robusta Alerts UI, instead of managing them as PrometheusRule YAMLs in-cluster.

This lets your team create and customize Prometheus alerts with templates, without needing to know PromQL.

This guide covers how it works, and also the steps involved to use this feature.

How it works
--------------------

Robusta manages the list of alerts in the Robusta UI and syncs them to your clusters as managed PrometheusRule files (CRDs).

You can disable/enable individual alerts and change thresholds via the UI.

Robusta uses the ``enabledManagedConfiguration`` Helm value to determine whether to sync alerts from the Alerts UI to your cluster, by default in ``generated_values.yaml`` it is set to ``true``.

.. code-block:: yaml

   enabledManagedConfiguration: true 

Important to mention that Robusta stores its managed rules in PrometheusRules custom resources that start with ``robusta-prometheus.rules--``. If left in the cluster, you might have double alerts.


Enable Alerts UI for your cluster
********************************************

Choose the appropriate instructions below, based on whether you use the Prometheus bundled with Robusta or your own Prometheus.

.. tab-set::
   .. tab-item:: Robusta’s Prometheus

      Make sure that the ``enabledManagedConfiguration`` value is set to ``true`` in ``generated_values.yaml``:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        enabledManagedConfiguration: true 

      Then perform a :ref:`Helm Upgrade <Simple Upgrade>`.

   .. tab-item:: External Prometheus

      First, ensure you have the Prometheus operator installed by running the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         kubectl get crd | grep prometheus

      To make sure Prometheus picks up Robusta's rule files, add the following to the Kube Prometheus Stack configuration:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        prometheus: # collect rules from all namespaces and ignore label filters
            ruleNamespaceSelector: {}
            ruleSelector: {}
            ruleSelectorNilUsesHelmValues: false

      Finally, make sure that the following snippet is in Robusta’s Helm values file named ``generated_values.yaml``:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        enabledManagedConfiguration: true # Enables managed alerts

      Then perform a :ref:`Helm Upgrade <Simple Upgrade>`.


Disabling the Feature
---------------------------------

If you choose to stop using the Robusta Alerts UI

1. Set ``enabledManagedConfiguration: false`` in ``generated_values.yaml`` and do a :ref:`Helm Upgrade <Simple Upgrade>`.
2. Identify the PrometheusRule custom resources added by Robusta

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl get prometheusrules -A | grep robusta-prometheus

3. Modify and run the following command for all the Robusta rule custom resources present in your cluster.

.. code-block:: bash

    kubectl delete prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com robusta-prometheus.rules<VALUE> -n <NAMESPACE>
