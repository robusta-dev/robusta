Manual Triggers
##############################

All the playbooks we have seen so far respond to events in your cluster.
You can also run playbooks on demand.

Example
-----------------
Let's manually profile a Python application in your cluster. No prior setup for the Python application is necessary!

We need a Python application to profile. Robusta itself is written in Python and already installed in your cluster,
so we can profile that. Get the name of the robusta-runner pod:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ kubectl get pods -A | grep robusta-runner
    default       robusta-runner-8f4558f9b-pcbj9


Trigger the ``python_profiler`` playbook via the ``robusta`` cli:

.. code-block:: bash

    robusta playbooks trigger python_profiler name=robusta-runner-8f4558f9b-pcbj9 namespace=default

The profiler result will be sent to all default sinks. Here is an example result in Slack:
