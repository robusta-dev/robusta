Loading External Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Robusta can load playbook actions from external git repositories. This extends Robusta with additional actions for
use in :ref:`customPlaybooks<customPlaybooks>`.

.. warning::

    Robusta does not watch for changes in git repositories. Playbooks are reloaded when:

    * Robusta starts
    * Robusta's configuration changes
    * ``robusta playbooks reload`` is run

External actions are loaded using the ``playbookRepos`` Helm value, with either HTTPs or SSH.

If you are going to be using an external repository via HTTPS, you just need to configure
correct read access credentials (see below). When connecting via SSH, however, there is an
additional requirement to verify the remote host's identity on the client side, as SSH
generally does not provide any method of doing that automatically (in contrast with HTTPS,
which relies on the well established cryptographic infrastructure of certificates).

In order to streamline the process of SSH host key verification, Robusta ships with verified
host keys for the following popular Git providers:

* github.com
* gitlab.com
* bitbucket.org
* ssh.dev.azure.com

If you are using a Git service outside of that list, you should add its SSH host keys in Robusta
configuration. This is done via the `CUSTOM_SSH_HOST_KEYS` environment variable with the list
of keys separated by newlines:

.. code-block:: yaml

    runner:
      additional_env_vars:
        - name: CUSTOM_SSH_HOST_KEYS
        # codeberg.org host keys
          value: |
            |1|TVOSCWl9+tXzKniecqFzaidE+yA=|XgOrtH2kjzERBPrbC9aGbaisnDE= ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC8hZi7K1/2E2uBX8gwPRJAHvRAob+3Sn+y2hxiEhN0buv1igjYFTgFO2qQD8vLfU/HT/P/rqvEeTvaDfY1y/vcvQ8+YuUYyTwE2UaVU5aJv89y6PEZBYycaJCPdGIfZlLMmjilh/Sk8IWSEK6dQr+g686lu5cSWrFW60ixWpHpEVB26eRWin3lKYWSQGMwwKv4LwmW3ouqqs4Z4vsqRFqXJ/eCi3yhpT+nOjljXvZKiYTpYajqUC48IHAxTWugrKe1vXWOPxVXXMQEPsaIRc2hpK+v1LmfB7GnEGvF1UAKnEZbUuiD9PBEeD5a1MZQIzcoPWCrTxipEpuXQ5Tni4mN

Another option to automate host key verification is the `GIT_REPOS_VERIFIED_HOSTS` environment
variable.

.. warning::

    **DANGER ZONE**

    Using the `GIT_REPOS_VERIFIED_HOSTS` variable is generally not recommended due to
    security issues. Each host added this way will be automatically trusted *without*
    an actual host key verification, potentially allowing man-in-the-middle attacks with
    catastrophic implications. For more information, see
    `here <https://www.ssh.com/academy/attack/man-in-the-middle>`_.

    Please make sure you know what you are doing before using this functionality.

An example of using that configuration option:

.. code-block:: yaml

    runner:
      additional_env_vars:
        - name: GIT_REPOS_VERIFIED_HOSTS
          value: "ssh.yourhost.com ssh.anotherhost.com"

Loading Actions from Public Git Repo
------------------------------------------

Use HTTPs to load actions:

.. code-block:: yaml

    playbookRepos:
      # add playbooks from https://github.com/robusta-dev/robusta-chaos
      my_extra_playbooks:
        url: "https://github.com/robusta-dev/robusta-chaos.git"
        # branch: some_branch    # optional: which git branch to install from
        # pip_install: True      # optional: load this playbook's dependencies (default True)

Loading Actions from Private Git Repos
-----------------------------------------

For private repos, load actions using SSH not HTTPs.

This method works for public repos too:

.. code-block:: yaml

    playbookRepos:
      # add the same playbooks as above, this time over ssh
      my_extra_playbooks:
        url: "git@github.com:robusta-dev/robusta-chaos.git"
        key: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBPUEVOU1NIIFBSSVZBVEUgS0VZLS0tL
        # branch: some_branch    # optional: which git branch to install from
        # pip_install: True      # optional: load this playbook's dependencies (default True)


The ``key`` parameter must contain a ``base64`` encoded deployment key with ``read`` access.

.. admonition:: Example deployment key

     .. code-block:: yaml

        -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
        ewfrcfsfvC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vb.....
        -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----


Handling Secrets
*******************

To avoid including Secrets in ``playbookRepos``, save your SSH key in a
`Kubernetes Secret <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`_.
Then reference it using an environment variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    additional_env_vars:
     - name: GITHUB_SSH_KEY
       valueFrom:
         secretKeyRef:
           name: ssh-key
           key: id_rsa

    playbookRepos:
      my_extra_playbooks:
        url: "git@github.com:robusta-dev/robusta-chaos.git"
        key: "{{env.GITHUB_SSH_KEY}}"

Baking Actions into a Custom Image
--------------------------------------

By default, Robusta loads custom actions at runtime. You can also bake custom actions into Robusta at build time. To do so:

1. Create a custom image that inherits from the robusta-runner image. Copy your actions into the image and install them into site-packages with all dependencies.

.. code-block::

    COPY my_playbooks/ /etc/robusta/playbooks/my_playbooks
    RUN python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir /etc/robusta/playbooks/my_playbooks

2. Load your actions with a ``file:///`` url and ``pip_install: False``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    playbookRepos:
      my_extra_playbooks:
        url: "file:///etc/robusta/playbooks/my_playbooks"
        pip_install: False

3. Configure Robusta's Helm value to use your custom image.
