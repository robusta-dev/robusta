Overview
===========

With Robusta you can respond to alerts faster and more reliably, by using automation. This is done by defining "playbooks" or automation workflows.

Automation for Prometheus Alerts
-----------------------------------

Robusta can automate the response to Prometheus alerts. Here are common automation types:

* Enrich - add missing context to alerts
* Remediate - automatically fix issues
* Silence - suppress alerts based on complex conditions to reduce noise

Automation for Kubernetes Changes
--------------------------------------------------

You can also automate the response to Kubernetes resource changes:

* Create Finding - generate a notification for a change of interest
* Enrich - add context to notifications generated by "Create Finding"
* Remediate - run a Job in response to a Kubernetes event or change

How Automations Work
---------------------

Automations in Robusta are called playbooks and they are defined in YAML in your Robusta Helm values.

Every playbook consists of two parts:

* A :ref:`Trigger <Triggers Reference>` condition that defines when the automation runs
* An :ref:`Action <Actions Reference>` that defines what the automation does (typically falling into the above categories like enrich, remediate, silence, etc)
