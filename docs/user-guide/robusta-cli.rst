Using the cli

    List current custom playbooks directories in the cluster

    Reload all playbooks in the cluster

    Pull custom playbooks from the current cluster into a local directory

Additional CLI Commands
---------------------------

You can view additional commands with ``robusta --help``.

These two commands are useful for changing Robusta configurations without doing a Helm re-deploy:

``robusta edit-config``
    Bypass helm and edit Robusta's configuration directly

``robusta playbooks configure``
    Bypass helm and push a new Robusta configuration

.. warning:: Changes made by these commands will be overridden by Helm next time it updates your cluster. Furthermore, the internal Robusta configuration file has a slightly different format than the Helm values.
