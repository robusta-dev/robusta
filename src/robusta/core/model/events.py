# 1. this is a dataclass but we need to make all fields optional in subclasses because of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51575931/
# 2. this can't be a pydantic BaseModel because of various pydantic bugs (see https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/pull/2557)
# once the pydantic PR that addresses those issues is merged, this should be a pydantic class
